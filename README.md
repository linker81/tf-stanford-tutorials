# tf-stanford-tutorials
This repository contains code examples for the course CS 20SI: TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research. <br>
It will be updated as the class progresses. <br>
Detailed syllabus and lecture notes can be found here http://cs20si.stanford.edu

Using the material the instructor kindly makes available, I've tried to learn Tensorflow and in this repository you can find my efforts to solve the assignments and exercises. 
Please if you find any errors, don't hesitate to contact me.

I'm using Tensorflow API r1.0.1 / Python 3.5.3 and, for this reason, I couldn't follow some instructor's suggestions in the exercises.
